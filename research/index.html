          <span class="abstract">We build a general equilibrium model to study how climate transition risks affect
            energy prices and the valuations of different firms in the energy sector. We consider two types of fossil
            fuel firms: incumbents that have developed oil reserves they can extract today or tomorrow, and new entrants
            that must invest in exploration and drilling today to have reserves to potentially extract tomorrow. There
            are also renewable energy firms that produce emission-free energy but cannot currently serve
            non-electrifiable sectors of the economy. We analyze three sources of climate transition risk: (i) changes
            in the probability of a technological breakthrough that allows renewable energy firms to serve all economic
            sectors; (ii) changes in expected future taxes on carbon emissions; and (iii) restrictions on today's
            development of additional fossil fuel production capacity. We show that different transition risks—and,
            importantly, uncertainty about their realizations—have distinct effects on firms' decisions, on their
            valuations, and on equilibrium energy prices. We provide empirical support for the heterogeneous effects of
            different transition risks on energy prices and stock returns of firms in different energy
            sub-sectors.</span>

          <span class="abstract">I develop a multi-sector core–periphery model of the banking system with correlated 
            portfolios between counterparties and study how a sector-specific shock propagates through bilateral exposures 
            and common asset holdings. I use this to show how the relative importance of interbank and fire-sale contagion 
            depends on the size of the shock and characteristics of the financial network and markets. I first derive 
            explicit thresholds at which different groups of banks default as the shock grows and decompose systemic 
            losses at each threshold into interbank and fire-sale components. I then calibrate the model in a simple 
            multi-sector example and simulate the response to shocks of increasing size, showing that small shocks are 
            amplified mainly through interbank linkages, while large shocks are amplified mainly through fire-sale 
            spillovers once core institutions are affected. Finally, I perform comparative statics that vary key features 
            of the system—such as network structure, portfolio concentration, and market depth—and map them into the 
            interbank share of contagion at each default threshold.</span>
