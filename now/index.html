        I'm currently at <a href="https://nexushouse.co">Nexus House</a>, in Norden, California. I'll be heading to SF from July 4thÂ - July 5th, so I would love to meet up!

        Economics

      <p>
        I'm currently working as a research assistant under <a href="https://wellbeing.research.mcgill.ca/">Professor Christopher Barrington-Leigh</a>, on a collective action problem database. My role is to both rework the website so our database becomes a functional educational tool, and to contribute my writing to the database. To that end, I'd love any ideas on how to create a good exploratory database. 
      </p>

        At the same time, I'm studying <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Statistical+Analysis+with+Missing+Data%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9780470526798">statistical analysis with missing data</a> under <a href="https://saraswata.research.mcgill.ca/">Professor Saraswata Chaudhuri</a>. It's an interesting application of the knowledge I gained from my honours statistics class, especially given the whole host of interesting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">real world applications</a> in experiment design. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also trying to get through <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Social_and_Economic_Networks.html">Social and Economic Networks</a> by Matthew Jackson as a seminal text in network economics. This is to prepare myself for some economics research from a more theoretical perspective. The text is dense, and I would love a reading partner.
